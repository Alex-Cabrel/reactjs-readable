## Description
The project [Readable](https://github.com/Alex-Cabrel/reactjs-readable) aims at using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) to build an application where users can post and comment on certain topics. The application was bootstrap using reacts [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) utility and uses an [api server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) in which the categories of the posts are defined. Readable permits a user to post on the various categories. Also Readable, permits users to comment on, upvote, or downvote the avaible posts. The app equally permits users to upvote, downvote or delete comments.
